## Q. Am I using the right dashboard?
You should be using our dashboard that has a v3 in the url, so the url contains: `v3.nylas.com`

## Q. What do I do now that I have access?
You are not required to complete further onboarding, so skip the callback url, we've setup an app and Google credentials for you to test out your code sample.
