# How to Participate

## Hacktoberfest Guidelines

We will follow guidelines provided by hacktoberfest. Please review them [here](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#pr-mr-details).

## Working on an issue

View open [issues](https://github.com/nylas-samples/nylas-hacktoberfest-2023/issues) with the `hacktoberfest` label. It's relatively quick to create a code sample, and we are here to support you!

If you plan to work on an issue, start a quick dialogue with the maintainer and wait for the maintainer to assign the issue to you. We want everyone to get a chance to contribute, please do not take on multiple issues at once (chat with us before doing so). We will review assigned issues frequently to give everyone a chance to contribute.

After you are assigned a ticket, let's quickly chat via the issue, if required, we will provide access to our developer dashboard for v3 to get the necessary credentials, this is a relatively quick process and is open to hacktober developers to try out!

Once a PR is open and being worked on for an issue, ensure to link the issue to the PR. Linking an issue to development branch can be done on the Issue page (search for `Development`).

Only issues addressed via PRs will count towards Hacktoberfest participation. Only PRs against issues will be tagged with `HACKTOBERFEST` and `HACKTOBERFEST-ACCEPTED`.

## Like to create an issue?

If you have other code samples in mind that you like to contribute, open an [issues](https://github.com/nylas-samples/nylas-hacktoberfest-2023/issues) and request feedback from the maintainer before proceeding to ensure the PR will be accepted and count towards Hacktoberfest participation. We want to ensure the issue is correctly labelled for Hacktoberfest.
